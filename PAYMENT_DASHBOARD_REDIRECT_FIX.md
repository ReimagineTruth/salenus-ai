# 🔧 Payment Dashboard Redirect Fix - Salenus AI

## ✅ **ISSUE FIXED**

### 🎯 **Problem Identified:**
- **Duplicate redirects**: PaymentModal had its own dashboard redirect
- **Conflict**: Both PaymentModal and handlePay functions were redirecting
- **Inconsistent behavior**: Some payments redirected, others didn't

### 🔧 **Root Cause:**
The PaymentModal component had its own dashboard redirect that conflicted with the `handlePay` functions in various components.

---

## 🔧 **Fix Applied:**

### **1. PaymentModal.tsx - Removed Duplicate Redirect**
```typescript
// BEFORE (conflicting redirects):
setTimeout(async () => {
  setShowPiPayment(false);
  setPiPaymentStep('pending');
  await onPay();
  // Ensure dashboard redirect happens after payment
  setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.href = '/dashboard';
  }, 500);
}, 1500);

// AFTER (single redirect in onPay):
setTimeout(async () => {
  setShowPiPayment(false);
  setPiPaymentStep('pending');
  await onPay();
  // onPay function will handle the dashboard redirect
}, 1500);
```

### **2. Verified All handlePay Functions Have Redirects:**

#### **UserDashboard.tsx:**
```typescript
const handlePay = async () => {
  // ... payment processing ...
  
  // Redirect to dashboard to ensure all new features are loaded
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Redirecting to dashboard after plan upgrade...');
    window.location.href = '/dashboard';
  }, 500);
};
```

#### **HomeDashboard.tsx:**
```typescript
const handlePay = async () => {
  // ... payment processing ...
  
  // Immediately redirect to dashboard after successful upgrade
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Redirecting to dashboard after plan upgrade...');
    window.location.href = '/dashboard';
  }, 500);
};
```

#### **Index.tsx:**
```typescript
const handlePay = async () => {
  // ... payment processing ...
  
  // Immediately redirect to dashboard after payment
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Redirecting to dashboard after payment...');
    window.location.href = '/dashboard';
  }, 500);
};
```

## 🎯 **Payment Flow Now Works:**

### **Step 1: User Initiates Payment**
```
User clicks "Upgrade Plan" → PaymentModal opens → User selects plan
```

### **Step 2: Payment Processing**
```
User clicks "Pay with Pi" → Pi payment simulation → Processing animation
```

### **Step 3: Payment Success**
```
Payment successful → Success toast → Plan upgrade → handlePay function called
```

### **Step 4: Dashboard Redirect**
```
handlePay function → Dashboard redirect → User lands on dashboard with new features
```
